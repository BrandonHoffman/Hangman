Hangman
=======

This was a high school project of mine from early 2010 for my C++ gaming course. The only high school project I still have source for.

exe is compiled for windows and should run on any windows PC or a linux PC running wine. To play just download the zip file from git open bin and run the exe.

Esc: quits the game

After playing a game you must click the reset button before starting a new one.
